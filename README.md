# Guessing Game (Guess the number)

A simple python script which fabricates a guessing game where you have to guess a number between 1-10

For the audio file to work in the presented syntax ("Yay.wav"), you must put the .wav file in the same directory as the project.

If you just want the guessing function without the audio, simply just remove the playsound lines of code from the script.
